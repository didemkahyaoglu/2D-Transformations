# 2D-Transformations

In this assignment you will practice WebGL and 2D Transformations. There are mainly 3 parts.

1. Draw a mill: Make a windmill containing a triangular body and three rectangular wings. The three wings need to have different colors (red, green and blue).
2. 2D transformations:

    a. Implement translation, uniform scale, and rotation. When you scale or rotate, the mill need to be transformed locally (position shouldnâ€™t change).

    b. Rotation of wings: Speed of rotation can be controlled

3. Colors: Change color of the letters using the color controls.
